Mars is a red planet.
It has two moons.
A mistake was made.
Then it was corrected and it was easily fixed and the results were shared with everyone.
One moon was red... may be pink. Colour blindness wasdmaking it more and more difficult to determine the colour. What I thought was RED turned out to be PINK!!
The it intrinsically difficult to make out the colour of the other moon. By mere observation of the naked eye it seemed indigo but a closer observation revealed the colour was in fact violet. This is yet to be agreed by Joshua.
